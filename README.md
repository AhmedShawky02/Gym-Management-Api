## Gym Management System â€“ Web Application

### **Overview**

A comprehensive Gym Management System designed to streamline the management of classes, supplements, bookings, and trainers, while providing a secure, scalable, and maintainable backend architecture.
The project follows a **Clean 3-Tier Architecture** (Controller / Service / Repository) to ensure separation of concerns, easier maintenance, and improved scalability.

This system implements **secure authentication**, **role-based access control**, **media uploads**, and strong **data validation**, making it a robust solution for managing a gymâ€™s operations.
